# AI Maturity Reality Check — Improved Version

## What Changed

Your original design was solid. I made **only targeted improvements**:

### 1. Typography Update
- **Changed:** Inter → Manrope
- **Why:** More distinctive while staying professional and readable
- **Impact:** Subtle but noticeably more premium feel

### 2. Primary Button Enhancement
- **Added:** Subtle pulsing glow animation (3s cycle)
- **Why:** Draws attention without being distracting
- **Impact:** 20-30px glow radius that breathes

### 3. Choice Card Polish
- **Improved:** Selected state gets slight elevation + glow
- **Why:** Better visual feedback on selection
- **Impact:** 2px lift + 20px blue glow on selected cards

## What Stayed the Same

Everything else. Your original had:
- ✅ Perfect grid proportions (1.35fr / 0.85fr)
- ✅ Excellent typography scale
- ✅ Great glassmorphism effects
- ✅ Clean spacing and hierarchy
- ✅ Solid cursor system
- ✅ Good contrast and readability

## Deployment

Same as before:
1. Create GitHub repo
2. Upload: index.html, styles.css, app.js
3. Settings → Pages → Deploy from main branch

## The Difference

**Original:** Clean, professional, functional
**Improved:** Clean, professional, functional + 3 subtle premium touches

That's it. No redesign. No crazy effects. Just targeted improvements to what already worked.
